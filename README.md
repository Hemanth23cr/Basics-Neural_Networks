# Basics-Neural_Networks

Fully functional implementations of neural-network algorithms, in Python, using: Tensorflow and Keras.

## Dependencies

  * $ pip install tensorflow-gpu
  * $ pip instal tensorflow
  * $ pip install keras


## Tensorflow:
TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices.
